  * 00git-keymaps.patch: Update to the latest keymaps from upstream, as per

  [ Eric Miao ]
  * fix-race-condition-of-serio-driver-module-not-loading.patch:
    Work around race condition in PS/2 keyboard/mouse handling. This resulted

udev (175-0ubuntu9) precise; urgency=low

  * debian/udev.udevtrigger.upstart: only start on 'not-container', not on
    'container', so that we don't have to needlessly execute a shell here
    in the container case.  We're guaranteed not to deadlock boot because
    each of the 'startup', 'started udev', and 'container' events will be
    seen once and only once on a boot.

udev (175-0ubuntu7) precise; urgency=low

  * builtin-block-polling.patch: Fix default attribute comparison for CD
    drives, the default value of events_poll_msecs is -1, not 0. This really
    makes in-kernel polling work for those.
  * builtin-block-polling.patch: Apply to all drives with removable media, not
    just CD drives. (LP: #948663)
  * 00git-keymaps.patch: Update to the latest keymaps from upstream:
    - Dell XPS (LP: #910911)
    - HP Presario CQ60 (LP: #935804)
  * debian/rules: Drop prep and tarball targets. We want to use the upstream
    released tarballs.

  [ David Henningsson ]
  * Remove jack-detection.patch: Now that PulseAudio uses the new jack
    detection interface, we can remove this patch.

  [ Stéphane Graber ]
  * debian/udev.udevtrigger.upstart: Update to wait for 'container' or
    'not-container' to be emitted, then skip just exit 0 but still run
    post-stop if it's a container and run 'udevadm trigger' if it's not.
    This is needed until we have a proper device namespace preventing
    udev events from affecting the outside.
    (LP: #925122)
  * Make udev depend on upstart >= 1.4-0ubuntu6 to ensure the next reboot
    will indeed either emit container or not-container.

 -- Stéphane Graber <stgraber@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 17 Feb 2012 15:40:47 -0500

udev (175-0ubuntu4) precise; urgency=low

  * Add builtin-block-polling.patch: Set default polling interval on CD drives
    as well. The events_dfl_poll_msecs will not trigger if "block" is not a
    module, but built in. This will avoid udisks etc. having to poll from
    userspace, and provide proper ejection when the hardware eject button is
    pressed. (LP: #890592)
  * Add 00git-keymaps.patch: Backport keymaps from current git master.
    (LP: #901513, #902332, #902798, #914838, #922405)
  * Add 00git-persistent-net-xen.patch: 75-persistent-net-generator.rules: Add
    Xen. (LP: #897789)

udev (175-0ubuntu3) precise; urgency=low

  [ Andy Whitcroft ]
  * debian/udev.initramfs-bottom: ignore timeout errors from udevadm we
    expect (and indeed requested) in certain failure modes.  If we do not we
    will bail out early and not transfer /dev into /root which is always
    fatal leading to unbootable machines.  (LP: #818177)
  * avoid-exit-deadlock-for-timely-events: avoid deadlock when exiting
    by continuing to handle events with timeliness requirements.
    The timeliness requirement will be violated if we ignore them which
    is highly undesirable.  Also these events are typically dependant
    events and may well block the events we are waiting on leading to
    boot delays and uninitialised devices.  (LP: #842560)
  * debian/udev.initramfs-bottom: increase the client-side timeout to
    better cope with potential timeout extension issues in udev.  We very
    much would prefer udev to time itself out and guarantee to have
    completed than take action ourselves.  Very worst case the timeout may
    be doubled from the default of 60s so increase ours accordingly.  Note,
    we should only ever trip this timeout when we are already in severe
    trouble.  (LP: #818177)

 -- Steve Langasek <steve.langasek@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 16 Dec 2011 11:15:39 -0800

udev (175-0ubuntu2) precise; urgency=low

  * debian/udev.postinst: Ignore failures of "udevadm --convert-db". This
    option does not exist any more in Ubuntu 11.10 and later, so for upgrades
    from 10.04 LTS to 12.04 LTS you need to reboot. This doesn't really hurt,
    as there are already two dozen other reasons to reboot after upgrade.
    (LP: #887892)
  * Partially revert r2735 and move the daemon back to /sbin/, to better
    comply with FHS.
  * debian/udev.postinst: Use invoke-rc.d to restart udev instead of
    "restart", to pick up new daemon path. (LP: #889226)

udev (175-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  [ Loïc Minier ]
  * Update Vcs fields for precise.

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * debian/udev.initramfs-hook: we aren't using pkill anymore, so don't put
    it in the initramfs.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Unapply patches, they are not meant to be applied in the bzr branch.
  * New upstream releases 174 and 175:
    - Daemon moved to /lib/udev/udevd
    - path_id, usb_id, input_id tools are built-in commands now
    - fusectl filesystem is no longer mounted directly from udev
    - The long deprecated keys: SYSFS=, ID=, BUS= have been removed
    - The udev control socket is now created in /run/udev/control
    - The rules to create persistent network interface and cdrom link
      rules automatically in /etc/udev/rules.d/ have been disabled by
      default.
    - Support for 'udevadm trigger --type=failed, and the
      RUN{fail_event_on_error} attribute was removed.
    - Various keymap fixes (LP: #606599, #637695, #696671, #763525, #770680,
      LP: #795694)
    - Unbreak findkeyboards (LP: #881158)
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * debian/rules: Explicitly enable persistent net/cdrom rule generator by
    default. Upstream default changed, but this seems too much a change for
    12.04 LTS.
  * Drop move-input_id-to-default-rules.patch, race-condition-on-exit: Applied
    upstream.
  * jack-detection.patch: Port to new upstream version.
  * load-fbcon.patch, use_run_tmpfs: Unfuzz.
  * debian/udev.install, debian/udev-udeb.install, debian/udev.initramfs-hook,
    debian/udev.initramfs-top, debian/udev.installer-startup,
    debian/udev.udev-finish.init, debian/udev.upstart: Update to changed
    location of udevd (/sbin → /lib/udev) and the three now builtin _id
    helpers.
  * debian/libudev0.symbols: Add new symbol from this release.

udev (173-0ubuntu5) precise; urgency=low

  * Cross-build fixes based of patch by Colin Watson; LP: #873584.
    - Build deb and udeb flavors with
      --with-pci-ids-path=/usr/share/misc/pci.ids as this is required when
      cross-compiling but can safely be passed all the time.
    - Disable gtk-doc build when cross-compiling and exclude doc files when
      calling dh_install; building gtk-doc requires running a generated source
      (lt-gudev-scan) which is usually not possible when cross-compiling;
      should really be fixed to build this scanner with BUILD_CC instead, but
      this would require building whole projects twice too.
    - Also disable GObject introspection and exclude these files for the same
      reason as for gtk-doc (needs to run a scanner program which can't be run
      when cross-compiling).

udev (173-0ubuntu4) oneiric; urgency=low

  * Set a timeout of 61 seconds when calling udevadm control --exit, to
    ensure that udevd always reaches its *own* timeout first.  If udevadm
    times out before udevd, it exits non-zero, breaking the move of the /dev
    mount; and if we ignore the udevadm failure then udevd might still be
    running, which is the original issue that the patch for bug #624469
    was trying to address.  Raising the timeout doesn't make the boot any
    slower, it just makes sure we let udevd count the 60 seconds instead of
    udevadm.  LP: #818177.
  * debian/patches/race-condition-on-exit: Process events before signals
    in the worker thread, so we don't sit around waiting 60 seconds for an
    already-dead process.

  * debian/rules: Configure with --enable-udev_acl, the default changed in
    this upstream version because of newer systemd versions.
  * debian/udev.examples: Drop scsi_id.config, this file has been obsolete for
    a long time.

udev (172-0ubuntu5) oneiric; urgency=low

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 25 Jul 2011 16:53:47 +0100

udev (172-0ubuntu3) oneiric; urgency=low

  * debian/udev-udeb.dirs, debian/udev.dirs, debian/udev.postinst: Get rid of
    the remaining /lib/udev/devices/ stuff:
    - shm: will be symlinked to /run/shm/ by mountall, and avoid having a
      non-world-writable shm (which breaks e. g. ecryptfs)
    - net: created by devtmpfs already
    - pts: mounted as devpts by mountall
  * Drop debian/udev.init. It has a ton of deprecated stuff in it, and with
    upstream supporting systemd and us having upstart scripts there won't ever
    be a time when we go back to a sysvinit script.
  * debian/udev.installer-startup:
    - Drop copying of /lib/udev/devices/. udevd already does this, and it's
      obsolete with devtmpfs anyway.
    - Drop unconditional mounting of a tmpfs on /dev and mknod'ing stuff. We
      already have a devtmpfs there. Only mount devtmpfs if /dev/null doesn't
      exist already.

udev (172-0ubuntu2) oneiric; urgency=low

  * extras/cdrom_id/60-cdrom_id.rules: Revert "hd*" hack for powerpc; this
    already is, or should be fixed in the powerpc kernel configuration to use
    the SCSI interface. (Confirmed by Luke).
  * Move rules/rules.d/78-graphics-card.rules to
    debian/local/78-graphics-card.rules and install it in debian/udev.install
    instead of patching Makefile.am
  * Move inline change in rules/rules.d/80-drivers.rules to
    debian/patches/load-fbcon.patch.
  * Move extras/rule_generator/75-persistent-net-generator.rules inline change
    to debian/patches/ignore-eucalyptus-virtual-ifaces.patch.
  * Move libudev/libudev-monitor.c inline change to
    debian/patches/libudev-revert-SOCK_NONBLOCK.patch.
  * Revert autoconf files to upstream state, as we have no further direct
    patches to the upstream build system.
  * debian/source/format: Move to 3.0 (quilt) format.
  * Add debian/patches/use_run_tmpfs: Only use /run/ if it is a tmpfs. Stolen
    from Debian's udev 167-2, thanks Marco d'Itri! (LP: #807306)
  * debian/control: Update Maintainer: field to Ubuntu Developers.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.2.

    - Delete mobile-action-modeswitch, has been deprecated by usb-modeswitch
      for a long time now.
  * debian/rules: Fix build tree copying to cope with new upstream
    "build-aux/" directory.
  * debian/libudev0.symbols: Add new symbols for this release.
  * debian/control: Add gir1.2-gudev-1.0 dependency to libgudev-1.0-dev, as
    per current Debian GI policy.
  * debian/control: Wrap dependencies.
  * debian/control: Add versioned libudev0 dependency to udev. While udevd or
    the probers do not directly link to it (they have an internal copy), they
    still need to be in sync to work properly. (LP: #804577)

      have identical force-release-maps/ keymap files (dell-studio-1557 and
      fujitsu-amilo-si1848) and two more need to be added (Mitac and Coolbox
      QBook). This replaces the identical force-release-maps files with one
      'common-volume-keys' file to make adding new models easier.
      (LP: #565459)
    - Add force-release quirk for Coolbox QBook 270-02 (LP: #420473)

udev (151-11) lucid; urgency=low

  * Fix cdrom_id even harder to correctly detecting media. (Committed to

    - Rework feature/profiles buffer parsing: Previously we were ignoring many
      profiles, which could lead to misdetecting the content types.
    - Print more debug messages with -d.
    - Do not ignore errors from scsi_cmd_run(). scsi_cmd_run() can return
      positive error messages if we have CHECK_CONDITION set and get the error
      code from the SCSI command result. So check the result for non-zero, not
      for being negative.  This fix another common cause for "phantom" media
      in empty CD-ROM drives. (LP: #562978)
    - Swap media state and TOC info probing. Blank CDs do not have a TOC, thus
      will fail cd_media_toc() (at least with the "Do not ignore errors from
      scsi_cmd_run()" fix). Thus probe the media state first, so that we can
      properly detect blank media.

  * Add libudev0-udeb, for the benefit of input_id. We don't strictly need

  * Use --resolve-names=never in the installer and initramfs, since we don't
    have a useful name service.  LP: #319199.

udev (136-1) jaunty; urgency=low

  One of the biggest changes in this release is that the default rules
  are no longer conffiles and are now installed into /lib/udev/rules.d

  You may still add your custom rules to /etc/udev/rules.d and these
  will be processed after the default ones, and can thus override
  anything they do.

  To avoid side-effects of default rules (ie. running of programs),
  create the file with the same name.

  * New upstream release:
    - Changed to use autoconf
    - Default rules moved to /lib/udev/rules.d
    - udevadm symlinks removed.
    - udevadm info output for --device-id-of-file changed.
    - udevadm trigger has new --type option.
    - libvolume_id soname change.
    - libvolume_id now able to return multiple matches for a single block
      device, or no matches if conflicting metadata found.
    - libudev shared library introduced.
    - by-id/scsi-* and by-id/ieee-* links both created by Firewire disks.
    - Optical devices no longer probed for raid signatures.  (LP: #283316).
    - DEVTYPE=disk/partition no longer exported by default.
    - pnp support removed now that we have MODALIAS support in kernel.
    - Introduced /dev/block and /dev/char (see changelog for 124-6).
    - Rule matching engine changed, limits such as 5 ENV and ATTR matches
      and only one match for any other key are now gone.  NAME assignment
      is no longer special cased (subsequent assignments will now overwrite
      unless := is used).
    - Substantial memory footprint reduction work.

  * debian/patches/01-cdrom-vol_id-probing.patch:
    - Dropped, included in upstream release.
  * debian/patches/80-extras-dvb_device_name.patch:
    - Dropped, no longer compiles and won't be needed from the next kernel
      onwards.  Since these aren't boot critical, just do it in shell.
  * debian/patches/80-extras-firmware.patch:
    - Dropped, no longer compiles anyway so we may as well just use the
      upstream firmware.sh which also supports crazy PackageKit stuff
  * debian/patches/80-extras-ide_media.patch:
    - Dropped, the ide subsystem has had MODALIAS support since hardy using
      the media type.
  * debian/patches/80-extras-usb_device_name.patch:
    - Dropped, we no longer need to support the legacy usb_device subsystem
      since we've had the newer ENVTYPE=usb_device objects since hardy.
    - Bump minimum kernel version to 2.6.24 for the initramfs.
  * debian/patches/80-extras-vio_type.patch:
    - Dropped, we don't even build these modules. 
  * debian/patches/80-extras-watershed.patch:
    - Dropped, we do not used it in any udev rules shipped in this package;
      it can be separated out into another source package if other things
      still use it (which we should try to make them not).

  * Merged our rules with Upstream default rules, this results in a number
    of minor changes but achieves consistency with other distributions:
    * /dev/net/tun is now mode 666, the kernel documentation says this is safe
      since you still need CAP_NET_ADMIN to create tunnels.
    * /dev/srN are now the definitive names of SCSI CD-ROM devices, with
      /dev/scdN as deprecated symlinks to them; this is the exact opposite of
      how we had things before.
    * /dev/nvram is now in the kmem group, the nvram group has been dropped.
    * Removable disks have moved from the floppy group to the disk group, with
      floppy now largely reserved for real old-fashioned floppy devices (and
      the /dev/fd* devices are now all in floppy).  LP: #260982.
    * CD/BD-ROM devices should now consistently be in the cdrom group.
    * Tape devices should now consistently be in the tape group.
    * More video devices consistently in the video group.
    * Printers on printer-specific ports now in the lp group, ppdev module
      loaded when necessary.
    * The scanner group has been dropped, it's become increasingly difficult
      to determine what is and isn't a scanner; especially with multi-function
      devices - access to scanners is better handled by ACL now.
    * /dev/input devices no longer group writable
    * /dev/tty devices are now group writable (wall/write enabled)
    * /dev/rtc restored to root group.  LP: #306458.
    * Various changes to the way the dialout group is assigned, should lead
      to more reliable device groups thus specific rules dropped.
      LP: #264792.
    * Support for infiniband, iowarrior, usbdpfp, sxctl, rioctl, bsg and
      etherd devices.

  * Add LSB headers to init scripts.  LP: #312324.
  * Correct name of CD Aliases generator in postinst.  LP: #250232.
  * Fixed /usr/lib/libvolume_id.so symlink.  LP: #232434.
  * Dropped /dev/.static/dev.  LP: #253786.

udev (124-12) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Mount /dev/pts at the end of /lib/debian-installer/start-udev, as
    Debian's corresponding script does so and bterm needs it (previously it
    was silently falling back to legacy PTYs, which are no longer so readily
    available and are undesirable anyway).

udev (124-10) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Cherry-pick from Debian 0.125-6:
    - Move in the udeb /lib/debian-installer-startup.d/S02udev to
      /lib/debian-installer/start-udev because udev will now be started
      before the busybox init. Patch by Jérémy Bobbio. (Closes: #493865)

  * Add debian/patches/01-cdrom-vol_id-probing.patch: Do not run vol_id on
    optical drives if there is no medium in the drive. Doing so open()'s the
    drive without O_NONBLOCK which closes the tray. Patch backported from
    upstream GIT (released in version 126). (LP: #283316)

udev (124-7) intrepid; urgency=low

  * debian/rules.d/65-id-type.rules:
    - Ensure that ID_TYPE is set to "disk" for block devices that are

      this has been lost in favour of $DEVTYPE, but many things (including
      our installer) haven't caught up.  LP: #287807.

udev (124-6) intrepid; urgency=low

  * Backport addition of /dev/{block,char}/maj:min symlinks from latest
    udev rules; this mirrors the /sys/dev/{block,char}/maj:min symlinks
    found in our current kernel.

    If you have a device node, stat() it to obtain type, major and minor
    and readlink /sys/dev/{block,char}/maj:min to obtain the sysfs path
    of that device.

    If you have a sysfs path, read the "dev" file to obtain major and minor
    (it's char unless in the block subsystem), and then readlink
    /dev/{block,char}/maj:min to obtain the device node.

udev (117-7) hardy; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/50-vol_id-on-entire-disk.patch:
    - Run vol_id on the entire disk again.  LP: #192794.
    - The reason it was disabled upstream was to avoid the cases where
      removable devices don't issue "change" events and stale information is
      left.
    - Since this behaviour would not be a regression from gutsy, and losing
      support for LVM PVs on the entire disk is a definite regression (since
      it's documented to do it that way in various places) we've reverted
      the upstream disabling.
    - After 2.6.25 (so hopefully 8.10), the kernel will issue "change"
      events and always read all volumes; so this is a very temporary patch.
  * Place scsi type 0 devices in the "disk" group".

  * New upstream release:
    - many bug fixes,
    - ACTION!="add|change" now works as expected.

  * Enable the upstream rule_generator extra, and include the rules for both
    CD aliases and network devices.  These generate rules files for each new
    piece of unique hardware discovered, giving a consistent name thereafter.

    ie. if you add a new network card, it is assigned the next eth* number,
    and will have that number every single time you boot.  Likewise a new
    CD writer would get the next free cdrw* symlink, and keep that symlink
    forever.
  * Drop hard-coded cdrom/cdrw/dvd/dvdrw symlinks.
  * Install additional udev.finish script at rcS.d/S23, so it runs after
    mtab and updates the existing rules files.

  * 80-extras-iftab_helper.patch: Drop this patch since we're now using the
    upstream persistent net rule generator rather than requiring users to
    hand-maintain /etc/iftab.
  * 70-rename-netif-increment.patch: Drop this patch, was an obscure iftab
    feature that we're deprecating.
  * 25-iftab.rules; Drop rules file that calls the iftab_helper.

  * 60-mknod-symlink-races.patch: New patch that repeats the call to mknod()
    or symlink() as long as it fails because something already exists, and
    we haven't failed to remove anything first.

  * 90-persistent-dm-md.patch: Drop this patch, instead we maintain persistent
    symlinks for devmapper and mdadm devices in a separate rules file
    shipped with those packages.

  * 40-permissions.rules: place mmc and pcmcia block devices in the plugdev
    group, EPSON scsi devices in the scanner group and scsi media changer
    devices in the tape group.
  * 90-modprobe.rules: load the osst module for Onstream ADR* tape devices,
    load the ch module for SCSI media changer devices.

    udevd to suppress the logging of messages with syslog.

  * Move the rule to name devmapper devices using dmsetup into the dmsetup
    package, and from there to a correct 25-dmsetup.rules name.  This
    shouldn't have been mixed in with the persistent symlinks code.

  * Change the permission-applying rules to use ATTRS instead of ATTR.
    LP: #75753.
  * Move 50-cdrom_id.rules to 30-cdrom_id.rules.  LP: #75753.
  * Fixed /dev/pilot rule to use ATTRS instead of ATTR.  LP: #89687.

  * Drop the rules that used grepmap to parse modules.ccwmap and
    modules.inputmap, since these modules now use modules.alias
  * Drop dependency on grepmap.

  * Decrease minimum kernel version to 2.6.17, after some testing we can
    confirm that the rules we ship with work there.

  * Update the standard prep_/undo_/rm_/mv_/conffile functions to take
    into account current dpkg behaviour wrt obsolete conffiles.  The conffile
    is now moved out of the way in preinst and the moved conffile either
    deleted or moved into its new location in postinst; in postrm we move
    the conffile back to its original name.

    This means that the conffile is not present with its original name when
    dpkg configures the new versiom, so is not left in the conffile list as
    obsolete.
  * Purge backups of modified obsolete conffiles when the package is purged.

    which sd_* module to load.  SCSI/SATA machines will boot again now.

  * Replace DRIVER with DRIVERS where found.
  * Remove the local-top initramfs script entirely, this was only loading
    ide-generic.  For feisty we'll load pata_legacy for non-PCI IDE
    controllers (which doesn't take over PCI interfaces) and provide an
    option to force loading ata_generic for newer cards.

udev (103-0ubuntu1) feisty; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - %e enumeration removed.
    - MODALIAS key and substitution removed.
    - Most keys renamed (see RELEASE-NOTES).
    - Direct writing to sysfs attributes now supported.

  * Update patches:
    - 40-udevtrigger-filters.patch: dropped, the spirit of this patch is
      merged upstream and we don't need most of it anymore.
    - 45-udevtrigger-sort.patch: dropped, merged upstream.
    - 60-vol_id-swap.patch: dropped, merged upstream.
    - 70-ifrename.patch: largely merged upstream, keep support for "eth*"
      incrementing in 70-rename-netif-increment.patch.

  * Simplify the initramfs handling somewhat.  We now just trigger
    everything, and don't wait for things to settle; instead relying on the
    loop in mountroot() which will do exactly the right thing,
  * Use pkill instead of shell /proc iteration to kill udevd.  Ubuntu #65711.

  * Drop most WAIT_FOR_SYSFS rules, increase kernel requirement to 2.6.19.
  * Rework rules file to newer attributes and naming.  Drop some symlinks
    where they are not part of devices.txt and no other distribution
    supplies them.

  * Rename libvolumeid0 and libvolumeid-dev to libvolume-id0 and
    libvolume-id-dev to match Debian.
  * Restore the "writing udev rules" documentation now that it's not wildly
    inaccurate.

  * Add dependency on libuuid1, so we can call uuidgen during conversion
    to add a UUID to an existing swap partition that was generated without

  * Place vol_id in the libvolumeid0 package, and in /sbin, so that it
    can be used by other tools without depending on all of udev.
  * Include README that has a handy table of which filesystems support
    what.
  * debian/patches/60-vol_id-swap.patch:
    - allow vol_id to return UUID or LABEL (with -u or -l) even if the
      usage isn't usually a filesystem; e.g. swap devices with UUIDs
    - detect a swap partition with a swsusp signature, and extract the

    - libsysfs removed and replaced by simple helper functions
    - Support /sys/class and /sys/block being symlinks into /sys/devices
    - Programs no longer receive SUBSYSTEM as a parameter by default
    - Rename persistent-disk.rules to persistent-storage.rules and support
      tape devices.
    - udevtrigger and udevsettle commands upstream that take on the job of
      our own udevplug.
    - Require that rules use "==" only for a match, and "=" for assignment.

  * Rule changes:
    - Include a README in /etc/udev/rules.d
    - Wait for the ioerr_cnt attribute of scsi devices to appear
    - Video card devices now named /dev/dri/card*
    - IEEE1394 video devices now named /dev/dv1394/* and /dev/video1394/*
    - Epson SCSI Processors are probably scanners too, Ubuntu: #45412.
    - Places devices from the zaptel subsystem in the dialout group.
    - Create /dev/pilot symlink for Handspring Visors too.  Ubuntu: #43279.
    - Create persistent /dev/input/* symlinks for input devices.

  * 01-lib-udev.patch:
    - Mostly merged upstream, patch just stops the /sbin/scsi_id symlink
      from being created.
  * 10-selinux-include-udev-h.patch:

  "Some little token of esteem is needed, like a dish of cream."

  * Don't check whether a device is claimed by an already loaded driver,
    while clever and theoretically time-saving it turns out that various
    forms of devices can be claimed by multiple drivers
    Ubuntu #28654, #30377.
  * Load mmc_block when an mmc device is inserted; will improve once
    we get a way to determine exactly which mmc sub-module we need, but
    this will give us out-of-the-box SD/MMC card support for now.
  * Also load i2o_block for all i2o devices, again this is a temporary
    workaround for a bad kernel subsystem.

udev (079-0ubuntu4) dapper; urgency=low

  "May I return to the beginning? The light is dimming, and the dream is too"

  * Remove the /dev/.udev/queue directory at the bottom of the initramfs
    just in case we killed udevd while it was in the middle of something.

udev (079-0ubuntu3) dapper; urgency=low

  "There's gonna be a quiz at your ascension, not to mention any

  * Wait time for SCSI devices should be 30 seconds, not 3 seconds.
    Accidentally broken while fixing usplash timeouts.

udev (079-0ubuntu2) dapper; urgency=low

  "I'm brushing up on looking down."

  * Probe for PCI, ISA, PCMCIA, etc. brides, USB and Firewire controllers
    and docking stations during initramfs, to support more distant root disks.
  * Also probe for input devices so when it all goes wrong, you can use that
    USB keyboard to fix it.

  * Build the udeb separately without SELinux support, as that's not
    required during the installer.
  * Don't allow usplash to timeout while we run udevplug in the init script
    or while we wait for SCSI devices to get out of bed.

udev (079-0ubuntu1) dapper; urgency=low
  
  "You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic."

  * New upstream release:
    - %e (enumerate) in rules has been deprecated.
    - event environment now lists symlinks to device in DEVLINKS variable
    - device-mapper support for persistent disk rules
  * Dropped 10-udev-conf.patch, now included upstream.
  * Dropped 02-no-sepol.patch, as we now depend on that.
  * Added 10-selinux-include-udev-h.patch to fix build failure with selinux.
  * Increased versioned dependency on libselinux1-dev to that which includes
    matchpathcon_init_prefix.

  * Fixed dvb device naming to create correct format names, bugs in both
    udev rules to match the device and program to generate the right names.
    Ubuntu #20874.
  * Fixed a bug in udevplug that caused it to wait for an event to complete
    that it never tickled.  Ubuntu #20943.
  * Included firmware loading in the udeb so network cards needing firmware
    will work in the installer.  Ubuntu #20993
  * Plug devices in serial during the initramfs, provides a little more
    predictability of device names of the root filesystem.

  * Rule changes:
    - wait for the address attribute of network devices to appear in sysfs
      before processing.
      Rationale: solves race not yet fixed in kernel.
    - dropped %e from symlink rules; this means you will only have one
      /dev/cdrom symlink no matter how many devices you have - and it isn't
      necessarily predictable which one it is.  Software should use HAL or
      similar to present "human names" for devices, and sysadmins should
      use the /dev/disk/* names.
      Rationale: upstream.
    - /etc/udev/rules.d/65-persistent.rules renamed to 65-persistent-disk.rules
      Rationale: upstream.
    - place /dev/nvram in the nvram group.
      Rationale: Ubuntu #21571 and breezy.
    - load sg module for all SCSI devices.
      Rationale: Ubuntu #12434, SuSE rules.
    - place SCSI processors (SYSFS{type}==3) from HP in the scanner group.
      Rationale: Ubuntu #12434.
    - change permissions of removable devices (floppies, usb, ieee1394, etc.)
      to 0660 (the default) instead of overriding it down to 0640.
      Rationale: allows formatting of the media, and the groups are intended
      to imply physical access anyway.

  * Explicitly state cdrom modes as 0660 in case they've been dropped to
    0640 because they're removable.

  "Looks like you're not happy 'less I open a vein."

  * Drop -x from initramfs premount script, was there for debugging while
    it was new and shiny.
  * Include the general functions in the initramfs script, so we get
    log_begin_msg/log_end_msg, which we use to notify that we're hanging
    around for a while.

udev (077-0ubuntu3) dapper; urgency=low

  "Watch out, Europe ... We're going on tour!"
  
  * Include udevinfo and udevmonitor in the udeb for installer debugging.
  * Rework the initramfs premount script.  Instead of trying to do the same
    steps for everything, take different paths depending on the values of
    $BOOT and $ROOT.
    - BOOT=nfs means we only load network card drivers.
    - BOOT=local means we look at ROOT, if it's an ide device we might need
      to load ide-generic if probing the bus doesn't create it; if it's a
      scsi or sata device we might need to wait around for a bit for the
      device to appear
  * Load ide-generic if not already loaded when an ide device is detected.

  * Rule changes:
    - Change group of USB and IEEE1394 block devices to plugdev and change
      permissions to 0640.
      Rationale: pmount/g-v-m/hal needs them in this group to work.

udev (077-0ubuntu1) dapper; urgency=low

  "I think dynamic tension must be awfully hard work"
  
  * New upstream release:
    - no longer marks an event as failed when ignore_device is used
    - skipping of events with SEQNUM moved to udevsend
    - automatically prefix relative program paths with /lib/udev
  
  * Copy devices from /lib/udev/devices using plain-old cp, rather than
    find and cpio; find is in /usr.
  * Update installer startup script to use "cp -au" like the init script,
    instead of "cp -af".
  * Add /lib/udev/devices/kmem as there's no sysfs node for it yet.
  * Mount udev with mode 0755 in cases of no initramfs.
  * Explain to debhelper that we like the /lib/udev/devices permissions the
    way they are.
  
  * Rule changes:
    - Rename /dev/sr* to /dev/scd*, providing old name as symlink.
      Rationale: LANANA.  Ubuntu #20312.
    - Rename USB printers to /dev/usblp*.
      Rationale: expectation in cupsys source, avoids conflict with lp.
    - Rename device-mapper targets to /dev/dm/*.
      Rationale: names we used in breezy.
    - Change /dev/pilot symlink to be enumerated.
      Rationale: some people have multiple Palm Pilots (yes, really).
    - Add /dev/input/aiptektablet enumerated symlink to event device.
      Rationale: used in xorg.conf.  Ubuntu #18358.
    - Add permissions and symlinks for ltmodem /dev/ttyLTM* devices.
      Rationale: included in linux-restricted-modules.
    - Add enumerated /dev/cdrw, /dev/dvd and /dev/dvdrw symlinks.
      Rationale: appeared in breezy.
    - Left /dev/urandom permissions as 0666, despite being 0444 in breezy.
      Rationale: same write function as /dev/random.  Debian #332970.

  * Drop has_driver helper, instead just check ENV{PHYSDEVDRIVER}.
  * Directly use the upstream persisent rules, so we keep up with changes
    without having to copy them into the debian/rules.d directory.
  * Remove /lib/udev/ prefix from all program rules, and let udevd add it.
  
  * Replace devfs rules with a simple helper that atomically enumerates
    storage devices and allows us to produce the devfs-style /dev/discs,
    /dev/cdroms and /dev/floppy directories that the installer still uses.

  "I played Norway, my fjords were stunning!"

  * Load modules for all storage controllers in initramfs, not just IDE
    and SCSI; some SATA controllers identify themselves as RAID.
  * Load modules for network controllers in initramfs.
  * Call modprobe super-quiet and with blacklist support when loading
    ide-generic.

  * Add -b (block devices) and -c (class devices) options to udevplug that
    follow the right numbers of symlinks.
  * Add -v (verbose) to udevplug for easier debugging.
  * Dereference /sys symlinks given to udevplug directly.
  
  * Added debian/patches/55-run-program.patch which stops udevd declaring
    that the sky is falling just because a program can't be found, it'll
    output a warning (normally muted) and can be replayed later with
    udevplug -F

  * Fix pnp_modules which was generating device aliases, instead of device
    ids that we can pass to modprobe.
  
  * Fix a few bugs in the init script that prevented udev from being started
    on systems without initramfs, or after it was stopped.
  * Include null in /lib/udev/devices by default.
  * Simplify the udev.installer-startup script, the installer itself will
    take care of much of the heavy mountpoint lifting.
  * Include udev.conf in the udeb.

  * Correct a silly error in the udevplug manpage.
  * Use -Cmem -Cmisc -Ctty -Cvc in initramfs script to ensure we follow
    symlinks properly.
  * Depend on the version of module-init-tools that actually supports
    modprobe -Q.
  * Guard notify-reboot-required call for minimal systems.

  "There's nothing we can't face ... except for bunnies!"

  * New upstream release:
    - udev daemon is now run on startup, rather than first event
    - events are received exclusively over the netlink socket, you should
      leave /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug empty from now on.
    - events with a TIMEOUT are now processed immediately
    - disks can now be accessed through /dev/disk/by-label/ and
      /dev/disk/by-uuid/ if you know what disk you're looking for, but not
      what kernel-assigned name it has.
    - device nodes with default name and no symlink are no longer stored in
      the udevdb.
    - the "udev_db" option has been removed, and the udevdb moved to
      /dev/.udev/db
    - when there are queued events, /dev/.udev/queue will exist and contain
      symlinks to the appropriate /sys paths for each event
    - exit status of programs called by RUN rules is now tracked
    - if an event fails, /dev/.udev/failed will exist and contain symlinks
      to the appropriate /sys paths; this can be used to replay failed events
      later
    - rules with NAME="" will cause no device node to be created, but RUN
      keys will still be run.  Use OPTION "ignore_device" to completely
      ignore an event.
    - added WAIT_FOR_SYSFS="<attribute>" key to rule syntax, all built-in
      logic to work around timing has been removed and instead this rule
      should be used where necessary
    - syntax to test for existance of environment variable changed from
      ENV{KEY}=="*" to ENV{KEY}=="?*"
    - communication with daemons such as hal can now be done using sockets,
      use RUN+="socket:/org/freedesktop/hal/udev_event"

  * Repackaged for Ubuntu, we have sufficiently far digressed from Debian,
    especially in dealing with users trying to break their system, that
    it makes sense to just maintain our own package now.  Ironically this
    makes it easier to send patches back as we don't have to strip out the
    "back out stuff" hunks first.
  * Completely replaces the functionality of the hotplug package, which will
    be removed by installing this.  If you had custom /etc/hotplug.d or
    /etc/dev.d scripts, you will need to update those to be called by a udev
    rule in /etc/udev/rules.d/8?-*.rules
  * Depends on grepmap directly for the last remaining subsystems that don't
    produce MODALIAS variables, rather than indirectly using the old hotplug
    agents.
  * Provides its own initramfs-tools hook and scripts, replacing the /dev
    functionality that used to be built into it.

  * The plain udev binary and udevstart are no longer shipped; all events are
    received over the netlink socket by udevd and processed internally.  The
    general functionality of udevstart has been replaced by udevplug.
  * /etc/udev/links.conf is gone and instead replaced by the /lib/udev/devices
    directory.  If you need any extra device nodes, symlinks or placed in
    /dev on boot just place them here; they're copied over when the system
    starts.
  * The udev_root and udev_rules config options have been removed, if you
    really want to change these, you can; but beware that you'll need to
    change a lot of other things too -- they were just too difficult to
    reliably support when combined with initramfs.
  * All scripts removed from /etc/udev/scripts, instead replacements (often
    binaries for speed) are shipped in /lib/udev; you can replace them by
    adding your own and adjusting the rules.

  * All rules are now placed directly in /etc/udev/rules.d, rather than
    symlinking them in.
  * All of the default rules have been replaced with new rules; if you had
    modified the old ones they will be disabled but left in /etc/udev for
    you (with a .dpkg-bak name).  You'll need to update your rules for the
    new system, and place them in a new /etc/udev/rules.d/50-*.rules file.

udev (0.060-1ubuntu15) breezy; urgency=low

  * The kernel's input subsystem still hasn't been updated to use the new
    driver core and is still running /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug (udevsend)
    itself with a hand-constructed environment, rather than attaching data
    to the sysfs event.

    These hand-constructed events are missing the DEVPATH= variable which
    udev requires before processing its rules.

    Added debian/patches/hotplug_input_events which instead of ignoring these
    events catches those from the input subsystem and processes them by
    running /sbin/udev_run_hotplugd; effectively passing all responsibility
    to the old hotplug input.agent which still can deal with them.

    In the long-term, the kernel will be updated to use the driver core
    (there are patches starting to be floated now) and attach its
    information to the sysfs event, so this hack can go when that happens.

  * Well, that didn't work so well now, did it folks?

    Looks like good old Mr Kernel is _only_ sending some events down the
    netlink socket, and we really don't want to be ignoring them.

    Revert the ubuntu13 change, and instead start udevd manually at
    S04udev.  This isn't as much of a hack as it first appears, because
    once /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug goes away we'll need to do this anyway.

  * Patch udev.permissions such that /dev/input devices are mode 0600 rather
    than 0644.  This prevents a security issue where any user could, for
    example, sniff passwords typed at the console

  * /etc/udev/.dev/ moved to /.dev/. (Closes: #246592)
    If you do not want to see it anyway, just rmdir it.
    You will have to manually remove /etc/udev/.dev/ after the next reboot.
    You want to reboot soon anyway because MAKEDEV has been updated to look
    for the new directory.

    It cannot recognize some corner cases, so please check your system

udev (0.024-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
    "high" urgency because the package currently in testing sucks too much.
  * Removed patch ide-devfs_fix_no_media, which has been merged upstream.
  * Clarify README.Debian. (Closes: #241318)

udev (0.023-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Changed again the default rules source: now udev.conf will default to
    reading all files in /etc/udev/rules.d/. If the directory is empty,
    postinst will create in it a symlink to ../udev.rules.
    Please double check that it's the rules set you really want to use.

udev (0.023-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Enabled SE Linux support. Untested.
  * I wonder if I should make the package not depend on the dbus and
    selinux libraries, as they are only used by the little programs
    in /etc/dev.d/. I encourage comments.
  * New patch extras_no_logging: needed to make the dbus and selinux
    helpers compile. Side effect: disables logging for them.
  * Removed patch udev022_namedev_symlink_fix.patch, merged upstream.
  * Removed patch run_usr_sbin_udev which is not needed anymore.
  * Use tmpfs instead of ramfs. (Closes: #239941)
  * Use debconf to print the reboot notice and a warning for devfs users,
    patch courtesy of Scott Robinson <scott@tranzoa.com>. (Closes: #240291)

  * Modified the init script to unmount /dev/pts and remount it on the
    tmpfs.

udev (0.022-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "millions of flies cannot be wrong" release.
  * Switched the default /dev layout to traditional style.
    (Closes: #237482, #237484)
  * Removed the patches udevstart_no_retval and strip_trailing_blanks
    because they have been merged upstream.
  * New patch run_usr_sbin_udev: first try to run /usr/sbin/udev and then
    /sbin/udev if the first does not exist. This is useful to support
    D-BUS without moving all the related libraries in /lib.
  * New patch udev022_namedev_symlink_fix.patch, upstream bugfix.
  * Make the MAKEDEV wrapper smarter by checking if something has really
    been mounted over /etc/udev/.dev.
  * Depends on sysvinit (>= 2.85-10) to use the already mounted /proc
    and /sys.
  * Limit the /dev ramfs size to 1 MB, I hope this will be enough for
    any reasonable system.
  * Cleaned up the init script. (Closes: #237243)
  * New patch ide-devfs_fix_no_media: make ide-devfs.sh check if
    /proc/ide/*/media really exists before using it.
  * Updated udev.rules and udev.permissions.
    (Closes: #236708, #236602, #237478)
  * Added partial and untested support for SCSI tapes to scsi-devfs.sh.

  * Make the ide/*/cd devices owned by cdrom group.
  * Added default aliases for ttyN, ttySN and lpN.
  * New patch: man-dashes.diff, fixes unescaped dashes in the man pages
