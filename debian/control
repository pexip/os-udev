Description: rule-based device node and kernel event manager
 udev is a collection of tools and a daemon to manage events received from
 the kernel and deal with them in user-space.  Primarily this involves
 creating and removing device nodes in /dev when hardware is discovered or
 removed from the system.
 .
 Events are received via kernel netlink messaged and processed according to
 rules in /etc/udev/rules.d and /lib/udev/rules.d, altering the name of the
 device node, creating additional symlinks or calling other tools and programs
 including those to load kernel modules and initialise the device.

Description: GObject-based wrapper library for libudev
 This library makes it much simpler to use libudev from programs already using
 GObject. It also makes it possible to easily use libudev from other
 programming languages, such as Javascript, because of GObject introspection
 support.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.
